# 🔐 Anchor vs Pinocchio – Vault Program Comparison

This project compares two Solana smart contract development frameworks — **Anchor** and **Pinocchio** — by building the same `Vault` program in both. It showcases the differences in ergonomics, structure, and developer experience between these two approaches.

## 🚀 Goal

- Compare **developer experience** between Anchor and Pinocchio
- Analyze differences in **code structure**, **PDA handling**, **error handling**, and **data validation**
- Build a simple **Vault** program that allows deposits and withdrawals

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **PDA derivation** and account validation
- Instruction execution via CPI
- Account serialization (Anchor's macros vs. Pinocchio’s manual approach)
- Type safety, error reporting, and constraints

## 📂 Breakdown

| Feature               | Anchor                            | Pinocchio                       |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Boilerplate          | Minimal with macros               | More verbose but explicit        |
| Account Validation   | Built-in (`#[account(...)]`)      | Manual                           |
| Data Serialization   | Automatic with `#[derive]`        | Manual                           |
| Learning Curve       | Beginner-friendly                 | Intermediate to advanced         |
| Ecosystem            | Well-established                  | Experimental, lower-level        |
| Performance          | Higher compute unit (CU) usage    | More efficient (≈60% less CU)    |
| Dependencies         | Heavy reliance on 3rd-party crates| No External dependencies         |

## 🧪 Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Solana CLI
- Node.js (v16+)
- Yarn
- Anchor CLI (`cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor anchor-cli --locked`)
- Rust (latest stable)

### Install and Test

```bash
yarn install
anchor build
anchor test

## 🧠 Learnings
- Anchor significantly reduces boilerplate and enforces patterns, ideal for rapid development.
- Pinocchio offers full control and transparency. Valuable for advanced use cases where max perfomance is needed.
- Building both side by side helps understand the magic under Anchor's hood.
